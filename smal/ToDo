The profusion of PDP-8 assemblers is pretty bad, as each has 
a different set of features and syntax, even for common operations.
Here's a list of some of the differences:

SMAL8 pseudo-ops:
W defines word values, similar to PALX DATA.
ASCII does 1 character per word
IF
ELSEIF
ENDIF
INT defines an external symbol
EXT references an external symbol
COMMON
MACRO declares a macro
ENDMAC ends a macro
USE does a file include
LIST
ERROR
TITLE
SUBTITLE
EJECT
S
END
PAGE
SIXBIT implemented like PAL-D TEXT, but requires "".
All MRI and OPR instructions, and base IOTs are implemented as pseudo-ops.
Uses ":" to define labels, ";" for comments, "@" for indirect.
"=", "<", ">", "<=", ">=" for comparison
">>", ">>>", "<<" for shifts
"\\", "&", "!" for not, and, or
"(" and ")" are parenthesis, overrides precedence free left-to-right evaluation.
Doubleqote starts and ends a string.
Functions to detect forward references, etc.

PALX pseudo-ops:
END
ORG
DATA
TITLE
ASCIZ does 1 character per word
TEXT does 3 character every 2 words
BLOCK doesn't zero the space reserved
SIXBIT packs 2 characters per word, offset by 040
OPDEF similar to FIXMRI
PAGE
FIELD
IM6100
HM6120
VECTOR
STACK
PUSH
POP
PUSHJ
POPJ
NOWARN
Uses [] syntax for current page literals.  Closing bracket required.
No page zero literals.
No dot arithmetic.
Pseudo-op names all start with ".".
Uses ":" to define labels, ";" for comments, "@" for indirect.

PAL (Doug Jones) pseudo-ops:
DECIMA
OCTAL
ZBLOCK
PAGE
TEXT
EJECT
FIELD
NOPUNC
ENPUNC
XLIST
IFZERO
IFNZRO
IFDEF
IFNDEF
RELOC
SEGMNT
BANK
FIXMRI
FIXTAB
DEVICE
FILENA
I
Z


PAL-III pseudo-ops:
I
Z
DECIMAL
OCTAL
FIELD
PAUSE
$
EXPUNGE
FIXTAB
*
Uses "," to define labels, "/" for comments, ";" for multiple statements/line
Has FADD/FSUB/FMPY/FDIV/FGET/FPUT predefined.
No literals.

MACRO pseudo-ops:
DECIMAL
OCTAL
PAUSE
FIELD
Z
I
EXPUNGE
FIXTAB
DEFINE
TEXT stores 2 characters per word, by truncation
FLTG
DUBL
PAGE
*
$
Uses "," to define labels, "/" for comments, ";" for multiple statements/line
&, !, operators
" to quote a single character
() for current page literals
[] for page zero literals
<> encloses macros
Will generate links for off-page direct accesses.

4K PAL-D pseudo-ops:
FIELD
PAUSE
DECIMAL
OCTAL
Z
I
FIXTAB
EXPUNGE
TEXT
PAGE
XLIST
$
Compatible with both PAL-III and MACRO, but without macros, DUBL, or FLTG.

8K PAL-D pseudo-ops:
ZBLOCK
IFDEF symbol <statements>
IFZERO expression <statements>
NOPUNCH
ENPUNCH
EJECT
Compatible with 4K PAL-D.

SABR pseudo-ops:
ABSYM
ARG
BLOCK does zero the space reserved
CALL
COMMN
CPAGE
DECIM
DUMMY
EAP
END
ENTRY
FORTR
IF name, skipcount
LAP
OCTAL
OPDEF
PAGE
PAUSE
REORG
RETRN
SKPDF
TEXT
Current page literals only.
Address arithmetic generally disallowed.
Postfix # to increment an address.


Here's a partial list of pseudo-ops we still probably need:
FIELD
OPDEF
DEVICE
FILENAME
ASCIZ
TEXT
BLOCK
LIST/XLIST
