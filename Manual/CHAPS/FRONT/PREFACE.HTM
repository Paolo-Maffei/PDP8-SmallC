<H1><B>PREFACE<P></H1>
</CENTER>
</B>Since Ron Cain introduced the original Small C 
compiler in 1980, interest has grown steadily.  Even with today's 
full featured C compilers, the popularity of Small C remains 
strong.  The reasons are evident.  Small C is a self-compiler, it 
comes complete with source code, it generates readable assembly 
code, and its single-pass algorithm lets users compile individual 
statements from the keyboard to the screen as a means of studying 
the compiler's behavior.  Yet, despite its student orientation, 
it has the feel of a quality compiler and is easily capable of 
supporting serious development efforts in areas that do not 
require floating point numbers.  Finally, it is perhaps the most 
thoroughly documented compiler available to the public.<P>
My first book on Small C, <I>The Small C Handbook</I>, was 
written for the CP/M version of the compiler.  Small C made the 
switch to DOS in 1985 and since then I have refined it 
repeatedly--especially the code generating and optimizing 
sections which were rewritten twice--so that the current version 
is neater, far easier to understand, and generates much better 
code.  The result is that the compiler described here is vastly 
improved.<P>
This book is more comprehensive than its predecessor in that it 
treats the internal operation of the compiler; whereas, the <I>
Handbook</I> was just that--a handbook for using the compiler.  
There is even a chapter of suggestions for further development of 
the compiler that can be used for student assignments.<P>
The general plan of this book comprises three parts.  
<a href="../part1/part1.htm">Part 1
</a> is an introduction to the Small C language--an 
integer/character subset of the C language set forth by Kernighan 
and Ritchie in <a href="../append/biblio.htm">The C Programming Language[10]</a>.  Since Small C is 
a subset of C, this material serves as an introduction to the 
full language.  The concepts and syntax are the same, so moving 
to full C is only a matter of learning additional features.  You 
may begin learning C here without having to face the more 
advanced features of the language.<P>
<a href="../part2/part2.htm">Part 2
</a> describes the use of the compiler.  The library of standard 
functions is documented, efficiency considerations are discussed 
and compatibility with full C is detailed.  Finally, the reader 
is taught how to invoke the compiler and how to compile new 
versions of the compiler.<P>
<a href="../part3/part3.htm">Part 3
</a> is a play by play description of the compiler's operation.  
Both top down and bottom up approaches are taken, with everything 
coming together in the middle where parsing is done.  The 
run-time library's internal operation is not explained; however, 
a complete listing is contained in Appendix D.<P>
Appendices are provided that survey the 8086 processor, list the 
compiler and library, summarize Small C syntax, explain error 
messages and document differences between this version of the 
compiler and its predecessor.  In addition, there are appendices 
that index the functions of the compiler and the library; they 
give each function's source file, its page in the text, and its 
page in the source listings.<P>
I wish to express sincere appreciation to those who encouraged 
and assisted me in this work.  That necessarily begins with Ron 
Cain who wrote the original Small C compiler.  For his 
encouragement in writing <I>The Small C Handbook</I> I remain 
grateful to Marlin Ouverson.  For reviewing that manuscript, I am 
indebted to George Boswell, Hal Fulton, and Jim Wahlman.  For his 
invaluable assistance in reviewing the present manuscript, I wish 
to thank Tobin Maginnis.  To all of those who, over the years, 
have shared with me their fixes, enhancements, and suggestions I would 
like to say thanks for sharing in the evolution of Small C.  
Special thanks goes to Ellen Ablow, Sally Brenton, Michelle 
Hudun, David Rosenthal, Ann Roskey, Mike Welch and others at 
M&amp;T for their hard work and cooperation in this project.  
Finally, to my wife Glenda, who has patiently seen me through yet 
another Small C book, I express my sincerest appreciation.<P>
