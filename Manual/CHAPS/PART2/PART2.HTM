THE SMALL C COMPILER<P></H1>
</CENTER></B><P>
Part 1 only dealt with the Small C language; nothing pertaining to the practical aspects of program development was covered.  Specifically, we ignored input/output, program control, memory management, and the other facilities of the Small C library; nothing was said about invoking the compiler or about the assembly and link steps; and nothing about writing efficient or portable code was mentioned. <P>
Here, in Part 2, we deal with these practical aspects of using the Small C compiler as a program development tool.  The following six chapters cover: (1) the Small C library functions, (2) efficiency considerations, (3) compatibility with full C, (4) invoking Small C programs, (5) invoking the compiler, and (6) compiling new versions of the compiler.<P>
